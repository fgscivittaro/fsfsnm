Our goal is to use process-driven data to forecast future performance for baseball players, as opposed to current methods that use results-driven data such as batting average or home runs. To accomplish this, we will scrape player statistics, both process-driven and results-driven, from websites such as Statcast and FanGraphs and then conduct regression analyses to find which process-driven statistics have the greatest predictive value for forecasting future performance. We will then use that data to create forecasting tools and predict future performance, comparing our effectiveness to that of the classical results-driven forecasting systems.
